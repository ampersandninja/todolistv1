# todolistv1
This is my first standalone project to get comfortable with using Javascript in tandem with HTML.

Basic to do list to add and remove items from list.

To Do:
- Switch to JSON for data management

- Mark items complete
- Streamline process (move away from straight js eventually)
- Better UI
- Be able to categorize things
- Different menues for different categories
